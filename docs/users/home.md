## What is Twasi?

Twasi is an open source chatbot for the video-livestreaming platform Twitch. It is developed in our free time and will always be free to use.

## History

The Twasi-Project was started in Juny 2016 by Blechkelle aka. Jeff after the "Twats"-Chatbot developed by MrKrisKrisu was shut down. After a closed beta Twasi's first version started an open beta version that failed due to too many users using the bot. Later Twasi was rewritten as Twasi-Core built by a modular system to offer more flexibility.

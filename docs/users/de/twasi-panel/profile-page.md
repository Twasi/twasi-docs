We will work on the profile page during the Closed Beta of Twasi.

## Sections of the profile page

The profile page consists of a variety of different cards with diverse functions.

### Your Twasi data

In the "*Your Twasi data*" card you will find general information about your Twasi and Twitch account.  
From there onward you can also delete your whole Twasi account.

### Social Media

The "*Social Media*" section is used to connect your Social Media accounts to Twasi.  
Thereupon, developers can use functions of the connected accounts to implement new features to their plugins.

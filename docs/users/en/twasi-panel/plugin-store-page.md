## What is the plugin store?

The Twasi plugin store is what makes us unique.  
It provides plugins written by our own developer team and by other developers who used their creativity and skills to share their own plugin ideas with the community.  

### Who can write plugins for Twasi? Can I also write plugins for Twasi?

Everyone can write Twasi plugins! We provide a whole documentation just for that purpose.  
If you are interested in writing your own Twasi plugins, please have a deeper look into our [Developers Documentation](/docs/home).

### How can I install / uninstall plugins?

You can install any plugin you want to have by clicking the "*install*" Button. To uninstall a plugin that don't want to use any longer, just click the "*uninstall*" button.  
If you install a plugin, its functionality will be automatically applied to your instance of Twasi.

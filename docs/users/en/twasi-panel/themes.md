## Seriously. Who wants to work with a bad looking site?

Especially when you have the desire to scream out loudly, when you throw a glance at it.
But as we all know, taste is different. So we decided to have a bunch of cool-looking themes you can choose from.  

### How can I choose a theme?

If you have read the previous page of this documentation, you should know that you can find the themeswitch button in the header section of the panel. Its icon looks like a little colour palette.  
If you click on it, you will be prompted with a dialog that looks just like the following:

![Themes](/img/userdocs/twasi-panel/themes/themeswitcher.png)

As you can see, you might also use your Twitch banner as the background of the header section of your Twasi panel.  

And yes, there is also a Windows 95 theme. •ᴗ•

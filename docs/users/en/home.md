## Welcome

to the official documentation of Twasi. This is the user section which is dedicated to the users of Twasi who need help with setting up the bot or are looking for the functionality of features.

## What is Twasi?

Twasi is an open source chatbot for the video-livestreaming platform Twitch. It is developed in our free time and will always be free to use.

## History

The Twasi-project was started in June 2016 by Blechkelle aka. Jeff after the "Twats"-Chatbot developed by MrKrisKrisu was shut down. After a closed beta, Twasi's first version started an open beta version that failed due to too many users using the bot. Later Twasi was rewritten as Twasi-Core, built by a modular system to offer more flexibility.

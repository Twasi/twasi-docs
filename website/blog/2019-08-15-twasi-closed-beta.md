## Twasi Closed Beta

Twasi's closed beta will start soon. We worked hard on the core, the panel and the plugin-framework of Twasi and can proudly present, that Twasi and it's plugins are running stable and are very performant!

Now we need to figure out how good Twasi works under heavier load before we can publish our bot to everyone. This is a big step for us!

### Getting access to the beta

We will hand out codes for our closed beta at the **Gamescom 2019** and also on **Twitter**! So if you're interested in our chatbot leave a follow on our [Twitter-account](https://twitter.com/TwasiNET)!

## The Docs

We want everyone who's interested in Twasi-development to let their creativity run wild! The first version of our documentation just went online to help everyone who already has some knowledge in programming with Java to get started with Twasi-Plugin development.

Also we promise to add more tutorials and details into our documentation in the future! Feel free to help us improving our docs. Like almost everything of Twasi it's open source and you can find it [here](https://github.com/Twasi/twasi-docs) in our GitHub organization account.
